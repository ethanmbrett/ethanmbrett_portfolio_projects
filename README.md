<h1>Untitled Sidescrolling Souls-Lite Boss Battle:</h1>

This project leverages the Pixel2D package to make a souls-lite boss battle against a lindwyrm. Currently, the C++ files used for my Stamina component are the only thing available, as I am still ironing out some kinks in the builds proper. I eventually hope to expand on this boss battle and build it into a full scale level and perhaps even game with multiple enemies, puzzles, and environments.
